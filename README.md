# TASK DESCRIPTION

This project describes an air quality monitor that utilizes an Arduino Nano microcontroller and a gas sensor to estimate a "pollution index." Based on this index, an LED will blink to provide a visual alert when the air quality is deemed to be above a selected pollution level.This project describes an air quality monitor that utilizes an Arduino Nano microcontroller and a gas sensor to estimate a "pollution index." Based on this index, an LED will blink to provide a visual alert when the air quality is deemed to be above a selected pollution level.

**primary goal is to create a simple air quality indicator that:**

- Reads data from a gas sensor.
- Calculates a rudimentary "pollution index" based on the sensor readings.
- Blinks an LED as a visual warning when the calculated pollution index exceeds a predefined threshold, indicating poor air 
  quality.
  
**Components:**

-Arduino Nano: The microcontroller responsible for reading sensor data, calculating the pollution index, implementing the threshold logic, and controlling the LED blinking.

-Gas Sensor: A sensor capable of detecting the presence of certain air pollutants. For this project, we'll used MQ-2 sensor .

- LED : A visual indicator that will blink when the pollution index exceeds the selected threshold. 

- Breadboard: For easy prototyping and connections.

- Jumper Wires: For making electrical connections.

- USB Cable: For programming the Arduino and providing power during development.
