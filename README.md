# TASK DESCRIPTION

This project describes an air quality monitor that utilizes an Arduino Nano microcontroller and a gas sensor to estimate a "pollution index." Based on this index, an LED will blink to provide a visual alert when the air quality is deemed to be above a selected pollution level.This project describes an air quality monitor that utilizes an Arduino Nano microcontroller and a gas sensor to estimate a "pollution index." Based on this index, an LED will blink to provide a visual alert when the air quality is deemed to be above a selected pollution level.

**The primary goal is to create a simple air quality indicator that:**

- Reads data from a gas sensor.
- Calculates a rudimentary "pollution index" based on the sensor readings.
- Blinks an LED as a visual warning when the calculated pollution index exceeds a predefined threshold, indicating poor air 
  quality.
